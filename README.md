springwhiz is a little php project I started not that long ago.

* You can find the hosted version at https://springwhiz-babab.rhcloud.com/
* The github repository is at https://github.com/babab/springwhiz-php

Even though springwhiz-php has never even been officially released yet,
I've decided to rewrite it in Django since I think that will allow adding
future features a lot easier and faster.

springwhiz is not really at an interesting developement stage at this time.
